# NoteDetector
Exploration of real-time audio processing and frequency analysis in Python

Currently uses:
- PyQt5 for GUI
- PyQtGraph for real-time plotting
- SciPy for FFT
- Padasip (Python Adaptive Signal Processing) for adaptive filtering

Currently does:
- Real-time musical note detection
- Real-time plotting of sound waveform and spectrum

Future features:
- Harmonic Analysis
- Reading from .wav files
